## 📈 Enterprise Adoption Evidence
**AWS Well-Architected Alignment:**  
All implementations pass [AWS Well-Architected Tool](https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/) review with:
- **Operational Excellence:** Full IaC deployment via CloudFormation 
- **Security:** IAM roles with least-privilege principle enforced
- **Reliability:** Multi-AZ deployment + automated failover

**Interview Gold:**  
❓ *"How do you troubleshoot hybrid DNS resolution failures?"*  
✅ **Proven Method:** [Diagnostic Flowchart](docs/dns_troubleshooting.md) combining Route53 query logs + VPC flow logs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack Deep Dive
| Công nghệ       | Lý do chọn                              | Alternative Đã xem xét       |  
|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **AWS Transit Gateway** | Centralized management for 50+ VPCs | VPC Peering Mesh (rejected: scaling limits) |
| **Route53 Resolver** | End-to-end DNSSEC compliance       | Custom Bind9 on EC2 (rejected: maintenance overhead) |
| **BGP Routing**       | Active-active failover for VPN      | Static routing (rejected: no dynamic path optimization) |

## ❓ FAQ
**Q: Biggest challenge in hybrid DNS implementation?**  
>A: Achieving **sub-100ms resolution latency** between on-prem AD and Route53 required fine-tuning EC2 forwarder caching policies.

**Q: How to ensure VPN high availability?**  
>A: Implemented **BGP-based failover** with two customer gateways, tested 15s failover time during simulated AZ outage.

**Q: Cost optimization strategy for VPC peering?**  
>A: Used **Selective Route Table Propagation** to minimize cross-AZ data transfer costs by 37% ([Cost Analysis](docs/peering_cost.md)).
